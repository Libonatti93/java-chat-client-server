Simple client-server chat system in Java, we will develop a project that includes:

Chat Server: Manages connections from multiple clients and relays messages between them.
Chat Client: User interface for clients to connect to the server and exchange messages.
Project Structure
Chat Server: A multithreaded server that accepts connections from clients and relays messages to all connected clients.
Chat Client: A client with a command-line interface that connects to the server and allows sending and receiving messages.

Code Explanation
Chat Server (ChatServer.java):

The server listens on the specified port for new client connections.
Each client is handled by an instance of ClientHandler in a separate thread.
Messages received from a client are relayed to all other connected clients using the broadcastMessage method.
The server maintains a pool of connected clients to manage active connections.
Chat Client (ChatClient.java):

The client connects to the server on the specified port.
The user is prompted to enter his or her name, which is sent to the server.
The client has a dedicated thread for listening for messages from the server and another for sending messages typed by the user.
The received messages are displayed on the command line.
How to Run the Project
Compile both files (ChatServer.java and ChatClient.java).
First, start the server by running ChatServer.
Next, start the client by running ChatClient. You can start multiple clients to simulate a conversation between multiple users.
Each client must enter its name when connecting, and then can begin sending messages.
